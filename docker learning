Docker related question

It works on my machine but does not work on prod
- Some file missing
- Different software version like node version
- Different configuration

With Docker you can add package.

Docker allows different application versions to run side by side
and remove it once done (docker-compose down --rmi all)

It helps in build run and ship application 
Container is insolated env. to run the app
Virtual machine is relica of physical machine - VM requirs OS and slow and need memory

Containers are lightweight and share OS from the OS they are running on - they no need to physical hardware resource

Uses client . server architecture (client talks to server with REST API)

install docker - go to page

run docker version 

Create docker file that can create image
which includes:
OS, runtime env. Application files, libraries, env. variables etc.

Then we tell container to process the image (to run it)

Dockerfile (this is where we start)

FROM node:alpine *FROM where do you want to start*
COPY . /app *what do you want to copy into the image give file path*
WORKDIR /app *tell the image which directory you want to execute the file from*
CMD node app.js *run this file*

Now we tell docker to package our application by
docker build  -t hello-docker .
where -t stands for tag name 
where . stands for the directory you want it to be build in (where you terminal dir is currently)
Press enter

This will create an image, so see this image, write
docker image ls (ls will list all images in the docker)

now we can write docker run hello-docker and this will return 
hello docker from the js file we created above.

mkdir - to create directory
mv - to move file
touch - to create files
rm - remove files -r to directory
cat - to view content of the file
more - to view content but only in one direction
less - to view content in both direction
